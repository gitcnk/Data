# HW11

This HW is based on some real data related to Med school applications.  Code to access data is below. Please copy the intire line and paste into RStudio to access the data.

`med_school = read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitcnk/Data/refs/heads/master/MedSchoolApplicants.csv')`




Please answer the following using the above data:

## 1. Female vs. Male GPA Comparison

Using an appropriate hypothesis test, determine whether the **true average GPA of female students is higher** than the **true average GPA of male students**.

* Compute and present all relevant **summary statistics** (means, standard deviations, sample sizes).
* Create appropriate **plots** (e.g., histograms,density plots) to visualize the data.
* Clearly **state your hypotheses**, perform the test, and **interpret the p-value in context** of the problem.

---

## 2. Accepted vs. Denied GPA Comparison

Using an appropriate hypothesis test, determine whether the **true average GPA of accepted students** is higher than the **true average GPA of denied students**.

* The variable indicating acceptance status uses `A` for accepted and `D` for denied.
* Compute and present relevant **summary statistics**.
* Produce **plots** to visualize GPA for the two groups.
* Clearly **state your hypotheses**, carry out the test, and **interpret the p-value in context**.

## 3. GPA and BCPM (GPA computed using the following subjects: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Math) Relationship

Create a **scatterplot** with **GPA on the x-axis** and **BCPM  on the y-axis**.

* Compute and report the **correlation coefficient** between GPA and BCPM.
* Comment briefly on the direction and strength of the relationship.

---

## 4. GPA and Number of Applications

Create a **scatterplot** with **GPA on the x-axis** and **Apps (the number of applications sent) on the y-axis**.

* Compute and report the **correlation coefficient** between GPA and Apps.
* If you do this correctly, your correlation should be **close to zero**. Explain why the correlation is near zero.

  * *Hint:* Consider how points fall in different quadrants and how this affects the correlation calculation.
